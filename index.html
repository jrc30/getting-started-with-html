    <h1>Getting started with html</h1>
<b><u>How the web works</u></b>
<p>The web is a network of computers that exists as a collection of hubs. A computer will send a http request to a server, which then finds an appropraite <b>html</b> document and returns it to the user's computer thorugh a browser.</p>
<b><u>html = hyper text markup language</u></u></b><br>hyper - links<br>text - what you see<br>markup - how it looks<br>language - programming syntax<p/>
<b><u>Tags and elements</u></b>
<p>html documents are composed of elements. We instruct the webpage to incorporate elements through the use of tags.</p>
<b><u>Inline vs block elements</u></b>
<p>html elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an invisible block around them, so will reflect more detail in text arrangements.</p>
